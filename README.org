* ws813b led strip driver

A ws813b led strip library written in C for the microcontroller esp32. 
The library have a range of functions which operates/changes the leds colors.
The functions is not meant to be called individually but are enabled in a configuration
file which is then read by the "ledEngine".  

* Usage
The library supports several different "modes" which is enabled in the config structure. 
Several modes can be enabled at the same time for a unique visual effect. Each mode
have some common configurations such as *rate*. *Rate* will determine how often a function
operates on the led strip. 

To start the ledEngine, create a led_config struct and set desired values to its
members. Define the colors you want to display on the led in a /section_colors_t/ structure
and call initColors.  +Then call the init function and ledEngine with correct arguments.+

*** TODO 

- Remove need to create and allocate memory for /led_struct/
- Move /leds/ to *ws813b.c* 


** sdkconfig !IMPORTANT
*CONFIG_FREERTOS_HZ* Must be set to 1000 in sdkconfig for the rate and frequency variables to 
function as intended. If not set the the default is 100 and the update rate might not be as
fast as desired for some modes. It is however possible to leave it as is.

*CONFIG_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE* must be increased to accomodate the size of all the structures.
It is probably possible to use freertos /xCreateTask()/ to create a task in which the library
is used. This is the end goal inteded way of using the library but it has not yet been 
tested.

** init function
Call *init()* to initialize the library. The function is required to initialize the
rmt library correctly by defining *rmt_conf* and calling /rmt_config/ and /rmt_driver_install/.

*** TODO Add argument for pin n  

** TODO Set colors

To be added:
- Different ways to set the colors 
  - Repeating sections
  - Mixed sections
  - etc..
- Set new colors in runtime
- setFadeColors function

** TODO Config array
** TODO Example

* Config structures
This section describes all the structures in the library.

*** walk

Moves each led one step backwards on the strip each update. 
The first led will jump the the last place.
